# Anubis ìÅ¢

Ask Anubis to watch your front-end assets. When those files change, Anubis will inject them and remove the dead link, or reload the browser altogether.

## What Anubis is not

- [HMR](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/):
    
    This is not Hot Module Replacement is not not intended to replace it. Anubis is best used for websites with minimal client-managed state, and is not recommended for web apps or SPAs.
- [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/):
    
    Anubis shares some ideas from the days of old, but is not at feature parity with LiveReload at this time.
- [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/):
    
    Anubis shares some ideas with BrowserSync, but will never meet feature parity. Anubis does not sync scroll position, have a dashboard, etc.

## What Anubis excels at
- Injecting CSS changes (via `link` tags, no `style` support yet)
- Reloading the browser when other files change
- Being very fast and light weight
- Makes working with backend servers easy (does not expect your project to be an SPA)
